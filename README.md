![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/502069af-6565-481b-a6f6-b12e388fa2ec)


**ARIS** (Automated Reporting and Information System) is a digital platform designed to modernize and optimize the management of complaints and reports within the **Internal Affairs Unit (IAU)** of the **National Police Service of Kenya**. This project aims to improve transparency, efficiency, and accountability in handling citizen complaints against police misconduct.

ARIS allows citizens to submit complaints quickly and easily, track the progress of their cases, and ensure that each complaint is documented, investigated, and resolved in a timely manner. Additionally, the system facilitates data collection and analysis to identify behavioral patterns and improve training and supervision policies.
